# Misfortune Cookie

You can never expect what you will get from a fortune cookie, but with this Misfortune Cookie generator, one thing is certain -it will be unfortunate!
It was said that humour is derived from the misfortune of others but as it turns out, *cracking* a joke at one's bad luck, can be just as funny.
